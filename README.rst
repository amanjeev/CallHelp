Call Help
=========

The Idea
--------

The application is about calling (and texting) for help when you are going through a dark or a possibly an unsafe place. Hoping that you are getting phone signal, instead of fidgeting with your phone to dial 911 (or number of a loved one) and keeping your thumb on the *Call* button, why not have an application where there is a big fat button that when released calls your choice of (previously saved) number or pull up 911 dial screen.
